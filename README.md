# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

To play the poker game the folder in which it is saved must be open on the terminal. Then the command python poker_game.py <NUMBER OF PLAYERS> can be run. Insert a number into <NUMBER OF PLAYERS>. The program will then ask the names of all the players, then choose a random list of numbers that correlate to the cards, compare the cards, and announce the winner's name. The player with the highest card is the winner.
