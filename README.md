# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

I have been having trouble updating my posts so here are what my posts are supposed to say:

*Goals*
I am so excited to be in Lisbon. By the end of my 6 weeks I hope to make a Portuguese friend and have a basic understanding of Python and R and be able to use numpy and beaver. I hope to learn a lot because I have no coding experience whatsoever. I am also hoping to learn some Portuguese. Can't wait to explore!

*Poker*
The first project I have completed here in Lisbon includes the blog you are currently reading and the poker game in this <a href="https://github.com/ix-ds-lisbon-s1-2019/week-1-project-gpetrosini.git"> repo </a>. To write the code for this poker game I needed to understand two topics that I had lots of trouble with: classes and functions. With lots of help from Manuel, Brad, Genc, and my classmates I was finally able to create a poker game that works! Though it doesn't take the suits into account, I am very proud of my project. I am excited to create more using the programming languages and packages we use in class and am looking forward to the internship projects.


To play the poker game the folder in which it is saved must be open on the terminal. Then the command python poker_game.py <NUMBER OF PLAYERS> can be run. Insert a number into <NUMBER OF PLAYERS>. The program will then ask the names of all the players, then choose a random list of numbers that correlate to the cards, compare the cards, and announce the winner's name. The player with the highest card is the winner.

Blog is live, poker game executes but it is just missing printing out the players' hands.

Blog had everything required (and a nice theme change!), but the explanation of the poker_game.py file could have had just that little bit of extra detail. Otherwise everything looks great!
